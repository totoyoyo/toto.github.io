# Review: Dunlop Aerogel 8000xl LTD

Hello~

This is my first badminton racket review! I write these reviews just so I can recall my own experiences with a racket. As I have gathered quite a large number of rackets, sometimes I forget how one racket feels after not using it for a while. Also, once I finish a review, I feel that I have *completed* the racket, and then I can sell it off with no regrets! My bag is getting too full T_T. Anyways, let's get started with a classic racket, the __Dunlop Aerogel 8000xl Limited Edition__.

Highlights:
- Super flexible shaft. One of the most flexible rackets out there
- Egg-like frame shape, in between oval and isometric. Kinda like the Carlton Vapour Trails' optometric head shape. 
- Aerogel used in the frame, very light material making the racket very head-light
- Very popular racket in Thailand back in the day.

## Background

The 8000xl is a hugely popular racket in Thailand, especially back in the day. The story is that Dunlop made a large number of these rackets, but for some reason, failed to export the rackets to other countries in Asia. Somehow, it all ended up in Thailand, and Thai people loved it for the cheap prices they got (because the supply was so huge). Mr. X from Exchange Badminton claims the 8000xl was one of the best-selling racket in Thailand. Due to its popularity, Dunlop made a limited edition remake of the model, which is essentially the same as the original 8000xl. 

## Buying Experience

I bought this racket for 2 main reasons.
- I was curious why this random racket from an unpopular brand was so popular.
- The racket has a "super" flexible shaft.

Almost all high-end rackets market themselves as stiff. You can easily find stiff, extra-stiff, medium-stiff, or medium rackets. However, it is extremely rare for a racket to market itself as extra flexible or super flexible like the 8000xl. I walked into a [Mr. C](https://mrc-sports.com/) shop in Bangkok and asked for the most flexible racket they had. They immediately guided me to the 8000xl. 

Maybe because I've essentially used stiff rackets my whole life, I was curious how a flexible racket really feels. What's better than to just try the MOST flexible racket out there? It went for only around 1800 THB, so it's worth a try.

## Setup and Specs
The racket is strung with an RSL 0.66 string at 24x26 lbs. The string was a free add-on but performed surprisingly well. But I'll focus more on the racket. I left the plastic film on, and I added 1 layer of cushion foam and 1 overgrip on top. 

The strung racket itself with with plastic film and nothing else:
- Weight: 87 g
- Balan.: 283 mm

Strung + plastic film + foam + overgrip:
- Weight: 98.5 g
- Balan.: 276 mm

From the specs, the racket is extremely headlight, but it never really felt that way. Even with the string on and no changes to the handle, the balance point is 283mm. Most of my past rackets would exceed 295mm after stringing. Yet, you can really feel the headweight of the racket when swinging it. This is likely due to the super flexible shaft, making the racket head lag very noticeable. Maybe extra-headlight + extra-flexible goes together the same way extra-headheavy + extra-stiff goes together.

## First Impressions
My first hitting experience was a disaster. I couldn't use the racket at all! The shift to an extra-flexible racket was so extreme I could barely hit the shuttle anywhere near where I wanted. I have recently let 4 other people borrow this racket, and half of them found it completely unusable. If I had the same time to test it out as them, I would probably agree!

However, given some more time with the racket, I eventually got the timing right. I had to work on a slower more controlled swing, and allow the flex of the racket to do its job. You could say this racket helped me improve some of my techniques, especially my clears and drops. Somehow despite the talk of "flexible means more power and less control," I found myself making fewer mistakes with this racket than usual.

## Experiences
Clears 10/10\
Clears were completely effortless. The racket head is light, so you need very little force to swing fast. But the super flexible shaft also generates good power at very low swing speeds. So, I have to swing a very light racket head very slowly, and that's enough for a full length clear. This has to be the definition of effortless.

Drops 9/10\
Drops were also awesome. The shaft helps guide the shuttle across the net with very little effort, and the racket head lag means you can still feel the racket head while placing a drop.

Smash 6/10\
Smashes were fine, but you cannot swing too fast or the shaft would not keep up. You have to use the same swing as a clear, and simply hit with a steeper angle.

Lift Defense 9/10\
If you are only lifting with this racket, it does extremely well. The light head means you can respond quite quickly, and the flexible shaft means you don't need much force to lift the shuttle back. Only downside is that these lifts may not be very accurate.

Drives & Nets 1/10\
Now comes the main weaknesses of the super flexible shaft, soft delicate touches and quick, explosive finger shots.
